# Task 1: Manage GitHub with Scripts and Document
# Description
Create a folder “Skills2022” and start a git repository. (Pictures can be found in folder (#Task 1)
note: 
1. The scripts you create for all the tasks will be copied into the repository “Skills2022,” including the screenshots.
2. Make sure that your local repository is connected to an online repository on GitHub (make your repository public so that I can evaluate the work, once you get the grades, you can make it private).

4. Take screenshots indicating the success of your actions.
5. At the end, finalize the README.md file indicating the list of all the tasks and your remarks.
